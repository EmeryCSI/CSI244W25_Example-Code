// Import the Express framework, which simplifies the process of building web applications
const express = require("express");
// Import the cors middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
const cors = require("cors");
// Import the movie routes from the movieroutes.js file
const movieRoutes = require("./routes/movieroutes");
// Import the rate limiter middleware
const rateLimit = require("./middlewares/rateLimiter");

// Create an instance of the Express application
const app = express();
// Set the port for the server to listen on, using an environment variable if available, or defaulting to 3000
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Add the rate limiter middleware
app.use(rateLimit);

// Middleware: Software that runs between the request and response cycle
// This middleware parses incoming JSON payloads in the request body
// It allows us to access the parsed data via req.body in our route handlers
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(cors());
// Routing: The process of determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint
// Here, we're using the movieRoutes for any requests that start with "/api/movies"
// This helps organize our code by separating concerns and making it more modular
app.use("/api/movies", movieRoutes);

// Start the Express server and make it listen for incoming requests on the specified port
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

// This server.js file acts as the entry point for our application
// It sets up the Express app, configures middleware, defines routes, and starts the server
// The separation of routes into a separate file (movieroutes.js) follows the principle of modularity
// This makes our code more organized, easier to maintain, and scalable
